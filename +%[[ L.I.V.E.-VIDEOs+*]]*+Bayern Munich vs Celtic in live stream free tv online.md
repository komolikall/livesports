Bayern Munich are tonight favourites to progress into the Champions League last 16 ahead of Celtic.

The German giants beat the Bhoys 2-1 last week, with goals from Michael Olise and Harry Kane putting Vincent Kompany’s side in cruise control.

While a late header from Daizen Maeda gives the Scottish champions hope, it will take some turnaround from Brendan Rodgers and his side. Still, if they can pull it off, it would surely go down as one of their very best results.

Here’s everything you need to know about where to watch the game.
